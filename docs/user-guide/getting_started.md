# Getting started

!!! info "Automatic migration of existing workflows"
    This chapter describes how to start from scratch with something simple, so that you get a gist of how this library
    works. If you prefer to try automatic conversion of your workflows, head over to
    [Script generator](script-generator.md) chapter.

As an exercise, we'll add a job that prints out `Hello world!`. Feel free to replace the actual workflow's logic and all
names with your own.

1. Install Kotlin as a stand-alone binary, e.g. from Snap Store when on Linux:
   ```
   sudo snap install kotlin --classic
   ```
   Make sure this is the newest version available. Kotlin scripting still has some rough edges, and improvements
   are introduced with each new Kotlin release.
   Also make sure that you use Java 11+.
2. Create a new executable file in your repository:
   ```
   touch    .github/workflows/hello_world_workflow.main.kts
   chmod +x .github/workflows/hello_world_workflow.main.kts
   ```
   This location is not a hard requirement, it's just recommended for consistency with enforced location of actual
   GitHub Actions workflows.
3. Put this content into the previously created file and save it:
   ```kotlin
   --8<-- "GettingStartedSnippets.kt:getting-started-1"
   --8<-- "GettingStartedSnippets.kt:getting-started-2"
   --8<-- "GettingStartedSnippets.kt:getting-started-3"
   ```
   Explanation: first, we create a workflow with the DSL provided by this library. The reason it needs source
   file path is to be able to generate consistency checks, to ensure that both source and target files are in sync.
   You'll see it in a moment in the generated file. What's written to the `workflow` variable is an object of type
   `it.krzeminski.githubactions.domain.Workflow`, it's not a YAML yet. However, a call to `toYaml()` extension function
   does the final piece of job.  
   Alternatively, apart from `toYaml()` which returns a string, there's also `writeToFile()` which puts the string
   straight into the file under path inferred by the library or name overridden with `targetFileName` workflow argument.
   It may come in handy when having a single script generating multiple workflows.
4. Generate the YAML by calling the above script and redirecting its output to the desired YAML file path:
   ```
   .github/workflows/hello_world_workflow.main.kts > .github/workflows/hello_world_workflow.yaml
   ```
   It can be also executed straight from IntelliJ, by clicking the green ▶️button next to the shebang.
   Notice that there's an extra job generated by the library that regenerates the YAML in job's runtime and ensures that
   it's equal to the YAML committed to the repository.
5. Commit both files, push the changes to GitHub and make sure the workflow is green when ran on GitHub Actions.
