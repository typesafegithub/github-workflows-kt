GitHub understand only this representation. In order to provide an alternative representation (here: using Kotlin scripting), we need to have a way of ensuring that whatever is described in the Kotlin scripts matches what is stored in the YAMLs. Otherwise, reading the Kotlin scripts wouldn't reflect what the workflows actually do. The only way of ensuring that e.g. no outdated YAML is run is to check the consistency before the workflow's main logic runs. The consistency check job performs the check directly before the main logic runs, and it's possible to perform this check on demand which is useful e.g. for workflows that aren't triggered in PRs. Adding the consistency check job to the YAML can be disabled, but it's not recommended if correctness is your priority, and should be done if you're sure what you're doing.</p> <p>We realize that this extra runtime step adds certain overhead to the workflows, and that in fact the users of the library compromise their workflows' performance and sometimes sacrifice money (Actions credits) to get more type-safe workflows. We're working on making the situation better, but for now this is the price you need to pay to describe GitHub Actions workflows.</p> <p>We've requested support for alternative ways of defining the workflows, not only in YAML: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/15904.

If IntelliJ already resolved the dependency from the old repository, you might need to delete it from the Maven Local   cache repository and after that restart the whole IDE as IntelliJ might not see the recreated file even after   executing the workflow script and the file was recreated in the Maven Local cache repository. (also see next points)</p> </li> <li> <p>A new release of an action added some input, but I don't see it in the IDE   If you depend on a major version of an action like <code>v1</code> and the action adds backwards compatible changes in a new   release that adds inputs, the generated <code>v1</code> bindings are already present in your Maven Local cache repository and   you do not get a new binding generated that includes the new inputs. To work-around this, delete the cache binding   from your Maven Local cache repository, which typically is located at <code>~/.m2/respository/</code>. After that, executing or   syncing the workflow script will re-request a fresh binding from the binding server that will include the up-to-date   state of the action.</p> </li> <li> <p>[KTIJ-31214] Deleting a dependency jar from Maven Local and recreating it leaves <code>*.main.kts</code> script with unresolved symbols until IDE is restarted   After following the previous step and deleting a dependency from the Maven Local cache repository to get it updated,   IntelliJ will not re-resolve the dependency and even doing so in another way like actually executing the workflow   script, IntelliJ still treats the classes as unresolved symbols. To get to a usable state again, you need to restart   the whole IDE, just closing and re-opening the project is not sufficient.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"faq/#how-do-i-add-support-for-a-given-action","title":"How do I add support for a given action?","text":"<p>By default, you can use any action you want, it's just it may not have typings configured yet.

You can use any action you want. Read on to learn about your options.</p>"},{"location":"user-guide/using-actions/#maven-compatible-action-bindings-repository","title":"Maven-compatible action bindings repository","text":"<p>When to use this approach</p> <p>This is the recommended, default approach. Start with this.</p> <p>To add a dependency on an action:</p> <ol> <li> <p>If you haven't already, add a dependency on a Maven repository that generates the action bindings on the fly:    <code>@file:Repository(\"https://bindings.krzeminski.it\")</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add a dependency on a Maven artifact, e.g. for <code>actions/checkout@v3</code> the right way to add the dependency in the    script is: <code>@file:DependsOn(\"actions:checkout:v3\")</code>. As you can see, the group ID was adopted to model the action's    owner, the artifact ID models the action name, and the version is just action's version (a tag or a branch    corresponding to a released version). If an action's manifest is defined in a subdirectory, like the popular    <code>gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v3</code>, replace the slashes in the action name with <code>__</code>, so in this case it would be    <code>@file:DependsOn(\"gradle:actions__setup-gradle:v3\")</code>.</p> Dealing with stale Maven cache, a.k.a. using version ranges <p>Additionally, the name part can have the suffix <code>___major</code> or <code>___minor</code> (three leading underscores). Without these suffixes if you request a version <code>v1.2.3</code>, the generated YAML will also use exactly <code>v1.2.3</code> unless you use a custom version override. With the <code>___major</code> suffix, it would only write <code>v1</code> to the generated YAML, with the <code>___minor</code> suffix - <code>v1.2</code>.</p> <p>This is especially useful when combined with a version range. The problem with using <code>v1</code> or <code>v1.2</code> is that for GitHub Actions, these are changing tags or changing branches and not static releases. In the Maven world, however, a version that does not end with <code>-SNAPSHOT</code> is considered immutable and is not expected to change. This means that if a new version of the action is released that adds a new input, you cannot use it easily as you still have the old <code>v1</code> artifact in your Maven cache and it will not be updated usually, even though the binding server provides a new binding including the added input. And even if you remove the old version from the Maven cache and get a new version from the bindings server, other people might also have this outdated version in their Maven cache and then fail compilation with your changes. It's worth emphasizing that this problem is currently present only when iterating on your workflows locally. When running on GitHub Actions, this problem doesn't exist because the state of Maven Local repo isn't cached between the runs.</p> <p>To mitigate this problem, you can for example use a dependency like <code>gradle:actions__setup-gradle___major:[v3,v4)</code> (from <code>v3</code> inclusive to <code>v4</code> exclusive). This will resolve to the latest <code>v3.x.y</code> version and thus include any newly added inputs, but still only write <code>v3</code> to the YAML. Without the <code>___major</code> suffix or a not semantically matching range like <code>[v3,v5)</code> or even <code>[v3,v4]</code>, you will get problems with the consistency check as then the YAML output changes as soon as a new version is released. For a minor version you would accordingly use the <code>___minor</code> suffix together with a range like <code>[v4.0,v4.1)</code> to get the latest <code>v4.0</code> release if the action in question provides such a tag or branch.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>If an action maintainer provides pre-releases that follow certain naming conventions as documented in the Maven Documentation, you might need to adjust the upper bound. For exmple a version <code>v4.0-beta</code> is less than <code>v4</code> and thus part of the range <code>[v3,v4)</code>. In such a case - or always, to be on the safe side - you might want to change the range to <code>[v3,v4-alpha)</code>, as the <code>alpha</code> version is the lowest possible version in Maven semantics.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the action by importing a class like <code>io.github.typesafegithub.workflows.actions.actions.Checkout</code>.</p> </li> </ol> <p>For every action, a binding will be generated. However, some less popular actions don't have typings configured for their inputs, so by default all inputs are of type <code>String</code>, have the suffix <code>_Untyped</code>, and additionally the class name will have an <code>_Untyped</code> suffix. The nullability of the inputs will be according to their required status.</p> <p>There are two ways of configuring typings:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Recommended: a typing manifest (<code>action-typing.yml</code>) in the action's repo, see    github-actions-typing. Thanks to this, the action's owner    is responsible for providing and maintaining the typings defined in a technology-agnostic way, to be used    not only with this Kotlin library. There are also no synchronization issues between the action itself and its    typings. When trying to use a new action that has no typings, always discuss this approach with the action owner    first.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fallback: if it's not possible to host the typings with the action, use    github-actions-typing-catalog,    a community-maintained place to host the typings. You can contribute or fix typings for your favorite action by    sending a PR.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Once there are any typings in place for the action, the <code>_Untyped</code> suffixed class is marked <code>@Deprecated</code>, and a class without that suffix is created additionally. In that class for each input that does not have type information available there will still be only the property with <code>_Untyped</code> suffix and nullability according to required status. For each input that does have type information available, there will still be the <code>_Untyped</code> property and additionally a properly typed property. Both of these properties will be nullable. It is a runtime error to set both of these properties as well as setting none if the input is required. The <code>_Untyped</code> properties are not marked <code>@Deprecated</code>, as it could still make sense to use them, for example if you want to set the value from a GitHub Actions expression.</p> <p>This approach supports dependency updating bots that support Kotlin Script's <code>.main.kts</code> files. E.g. Renovate is known to support it.</p>"},{"location":"user-guide/using-actions/#user-defined-actions","title":"User-defined actions","text":"<p>If you are in a hurry and adding typings is not possible right now, browse these options.</p>"},{"location":"user-guide/using-actions/#typed-binding","title":"Typed binding","text":"<p>When to use this approach</p> <p>It lets you create an action binding in a similar manner that is provided by the action bindings server i.e. a class that takes some constructor arguments with types of your choice, and maps them to strings inside <code>toYamlArguments</code>.
